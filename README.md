# Chain Reaction (a simple game built in Flash/AS3.0) 

My intention was to make a game very similar to yvoschaap.com/chainrxn/, since I had liked it a lot. Another reason was to familiarize myself with testing suites in AS3.0, and using Facebook's Graph API.

For the ease of measuring progress, I have divided the work in four simple steps.

## Step 1:
Introduction to important AS3.0 concepts (how function overloading works, stage, maintaining layers in stage, fluid layout)

## Step 2:
Using external libraries, frameworks (puremvc, collisiondetectionkit)

## Step 3:
Unit tests, regression tests

## Step 4:
Publish the app on Facebook, and use facebook's Graph API
